# Flight Simulation – Basic Aerodynamic Analysis

This **flight simulation** is a simple Python-based tool that analyzes the basic aerodynamics of an aircraft over time. The program computes and visualizes key flight parameters, including:

✈️ **Velocity vs. Time** – Tracks how the aircraft's speed changes over time.  
⚡ **Acceleration vs. Time** – Measures changes in velocity to understand forces acting on the aircraft.  
🛑 **Stall Speed** – Determines the critical speed at which the aircraft loses lift.  
🚀 **Thrust vs. Time** – Evaluates engine power output and its effect on acceleration.  

## How It Works
- Uses **basic physics equations** to simulate flight dynamics.
- Takes **initial conditions** (e.g., thrust, mass, drag) to compute results.
- Outputs **graphs and data** to visualize the aircraft’s performance over time.

## Why Use This?
This tool is perfect for **understanding flight characteristics**, **testing design parameters**, and **visualizing aircraft performance** in a simple yet effective way.
